# gp-docker-devenv: Build a Docker dev containers for VSCode

Copyright (c) 2023, Greg PFISTER. MIT License

<div id="about" />

## About

This is a simple Ubuntu container to use as development environment for Docker
projects.

This is image is provided with Ubuntu 22.04.

See [version](#version) mapping to find out which version Ubuntu and node and java.

This image is built from
[ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-base-devenv](https://github.com/gp-devenv/gp-base-devenv/pkgs/container/gp-base-devenv).

The image can be found
[here](https://github.com/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv/pkgs/container/gp-docker-devenv).

## Volumes

In order to persist user data, a volume for the /home folder is set. The root
user will not be persisted.

| Volume | Description                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| /home  |  Persist the user data stored in their home folder |

## Build, scan and push

### Versioning

Image version contains the Ubuntu version and the build version, using the
format `<Ubuntu version>-<Build version>`. The build version refers to the
latest Dockerfile script, when modification consists of fixing (patch change),
or adding or removing something significant (minor change) or breaking (major).

For example:

| Image                                          | Description                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04-1     | The latest build 1.x using Ubuntu 22.04   |
| ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04-1.1   | The latest build 1.1.x using Ubuntu 22.04 |
| ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04-1.1.0 | The latest build 1.1.0 using Ubuntu 22.04 |
| ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04-1.0   | The latest build 1.0.x using Ubuntu 22.04 |
| ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04-1.0.0 | The latest build 1.0.0 using Ubuntu 22.04 |

For CI/CD, the build version is store in `.version` file. The build version is
in the format
[SemVer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning).

Only the latest version (MAJOR, MAJOR.MINOR and MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) is been built
daily.

### Testing locally using `-dev` images

When you are making change to the image, use :develop at the end of the
[build](#build_dev), [run](#run_dev) and [scan](#scan_dev) commands. The `*-dev` tag
should never be pushed...

### Cross-platform building

#### Setup

In order to build x-platform, `docker buildx` must be enabled (more info
[here](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/)). Then, instead of
`build` command, `buildx` command should be used (for example:
`npm run buildx:develop` will create a cross-platform image tagged `develop`).

You will need to create a multiarch builder:

```sh
./src/scripts/buildx/setup.sh
```

On successful completion, it should at least have platforms `linux/arm64`,
`linux/arm/v7` and `linux/amd64`:

```sh
[+] Building 5.8s (1/1) FINISHED
 => [internal] booting buildkit                                             5.8s
 => => pulling image moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1                            7s
 => => creating container buildx_buildkit_multiarch0                          1s
Name:   multiarch
Driver: docker-container

Nodes:
Name:      multiarch0
Endpoint:  unix:///var/run/docker.sock
Status:    running
Platforms: linux/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/amd64/v2, linux/riscv64,
           linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x, linux/386, linux/mips64le, linux/mips64,
           linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6
```

#### Build commands

Once the previous step is completed, simpy run to build the current version:

```sh
(cd src && ./scripts/buildx/build.sh)
```

### Build using local architecture (for local testing)

<div id="build_dev" />

#### Build the development image

To build using a specific Ubuntu version, use:

```sh
(cd scr && ./scripts/dev/image/build.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)
```

where `UBUNTU_VERSION` must 22.04.

It will create and image `ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv` tagged with the current
version (see `src/.version` file) and `-dev` suffix.

You may alter the `.src/.version` file should you want to have different tags or
names, however if you PR your change, it will be rejected. The ideal solution
is to run the `docker build` command instead.

To remove the created image (named:
`ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:<UBUNTU_VERIONS>-<VERSION>-dev`), simply use:

```sh
(cd scr && ./scripts/dev/image/rm.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)
```

<div id="run_dev" />

#### Run or create/start/stop/exec a container

To run an interactive container of a give Ubuntu version, simple use:

```sh
(cd src && ./scripts/dev/container/run.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)
```

where `UBUNTU_VERSION` must 22.04.

Alternatively, you can create and start a container to run in background, and
execute scripts on this container, using the following scripts:

| Action | Script                                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| create | `(cd src && ./scripts/dev/container/create.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)`         |
| start  | `(cd src && ./scripts/dev/container/start.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)`          |
| stop   | `(cd src && ./scripts/dev/container/stop.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)`           |
| exec   | `(cd src && ./scripts/dev/container/exec.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>) <COMMAND>` |

To remove the created container (named:
`gp-docker-devenv:<UBUNTU_VERIONS>-<VERSION>-dev`), simply use:

```sh
(cd src && ./scripts/dev/container/rm.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)
```

<div id="scan_dev" />

#### Scan

To scan the image of a give Ubuntu version, simple use:

```sh
(cd src && ./scripts/dev/scan.sh <UBUNTU_VERSION>)
```

where `UBUNTU_VERSION` must be 22.04.

<div id="build-from-this-image" />

## Build from this image

Should you want to make other changes, the ideal solution is to build from this
image. For example, here's the way to set the image to a different timezone than
"Europe/Paris" (the default one):

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04

ENV TZ="America/New_York"

# Switch to root
USER root

# Reconfigure tzdata
RUN dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive tzdata

# Switch back to vscode
USER vscode
```

**Important:** unless you really want to use the root user, you should always
make sure the `vscode` is the last one activate.

<div id="version" />

## Version

_`Base image version` correspond to the underlying base image that can be found
[here](https://github.com/gp-devenv/gp-base-devenv/pkgs/container/gp-base-devenv)_

|   Image   |            Base image version            |   Ubuntu    | amd64 | arm64 | arm/v7 | Daily build |
| :-------: | :--------------------------------------: | :---------: | :---: | :---: | :----: | ----------- |
| 22:04-1.x | ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-base-devenv:22.04-1 | 22.04 (LTS) |   X   |   X   |   X    | Yes         |

## FAQ

1. [How to require password for sudo command ?](#faq1)
2. [Is there an example to use it with Visual Studio Code ?](#faq2)

<div id="faq1" />

### 1. How to require password for sudo command ?

You will have to [build from this image](#build-from-this-image) to disable the
the password less sudo command. Typically create a `Dockerfile` like:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04

ARG VSCODE_PASSWORD="dummy"

# Switch to root to make changes
USER root

# Remove the specific config for sudo and add to sudo group
RUN rm /etc/sudoers.d/vscode && \
    usermod -aG sudo vscode

# Change the password.
RUN usermod -p $VSCODE_PASSWORD vscode

# Switch back to vscode
USER vscode
```

If you simply want to get rid of `sudo`:

```Dockerfile

FROM ghcr.io/gp-devenv/gp-docker-devenv:22.04

# Switch to root to make changes
USER root

# Remove the specific config for sudo and add to sudo group
RUN rm /etc/sudoers.d/vscode && \
    apt-get purge -y sudo

# Switch back to vscode
USER vscode
```

<div id="faq2"/>

### 2. Is there an example to use it with Visual Studio Code ?

There will be one soon !!! Add notification to this project so that when the
update on this file is done you can check.
